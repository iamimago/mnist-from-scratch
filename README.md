# mnist-from-scratch
project for me to practice c++ and actually understand how to build a neural network from scratch. python is great and all, but i don't understand their weird vector simplifications very well, a good old for loop is easier to grasp. 

I compile with ```g++ main.cpp -o r.out``` on linux subsystem for windows (WSL 1).
